# Library
## Background
This program is a study in classes, STL Lists, and file manipulation. 
I am writing this program to act as both a refresher of classes as well 
as studying how to persist data in C++ without a database.

## Implementation
I am defining a custom `Book` class to hold the details of each book. 
It holds basic information such as author and title as well as 
information like genre tags. The main file uses an STL `List` of 
`Books` as the _library_.

## Interface
This program is meant to be run in a terminal interface.
